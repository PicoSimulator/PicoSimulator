#PicoSim

Picosim is designed to be a cycle-accurate full-system emulator for the RP2040/Raspberry Pi Pico and other similar boards. It features (WIP) full crossbar bus fabric simulation with wait-states and stalls and once complete will hopefully be indistinguishable from real hardware to software.
